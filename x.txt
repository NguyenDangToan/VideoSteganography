I Hate The Mornings
Because I Know What They Bring
You Get Up and Take A Shower
And In No Time You're Leaving
And It Sounds So Selfish
But I Can't Help But Think
That If You Knew How Much I Needed You

'Cause I Hate Goodbyes
I Hate These Tears In My Eyes
I Hate Myself For The Way I Feel
About You Everytime
I've Had Enough
I'm Sick Of Wishing He Was
Around Me Everyday, Everynight
Its Way Too Much
I Hate Love, Yeahhh
I Hate Love, Yeah
I Hate Your Phone Calls
In The Middle Of The Day
'Cause All They Do Is Just Remind Me
That My Baby Is So Far Away
It Drives Me Crazy
'Cause I Need You With Me
I Know Its Hard For You To
Understand When I Say
That I Hate Goodbyes
I Hate These Tears In My Eyes
I Hate Myself For The Way I Feel
About You Everytime
I've Had Enough
I'm
